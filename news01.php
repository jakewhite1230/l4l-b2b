							<b>Learn4Life Promotes STEM Disciplines at the SoCal Maker Convention</B>
							</p>
							<p>
							The SoCal Maker Convention is an event that merges science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) disciplines 
							with exciting, hands-on projects such as building robots, flying drones and 3D printing to educate and inspire 
							young people. The event saw a record-setting 5,000 students and parents in attendance.
							</p>
							<p>
							Learn4Life hosted a booth at the event, offering students free enrollment in flexible, personalized learning 
							programs and Career Technical Education (CTE) courses such as Agriculture, IT Essentials, Emergency Medical 
							Response, Aerial Robotics and Coding. Of special interest to participating students was the Learn4Life partnership 
							with Vocademy, a 15,000-square-foot space that teaches 3D printing, robotics, machining, welding, sewing and more. 
							These Learn4Life programs engage students while supporting the development of a STEM-trained and skilled workforce. 
							All Learn4Life programs are accredited so students can earn a high school diploma.
							</p>
							<p>
							“Our CTE programs provide hands-on training and qualifying high school credits so students gain practical experience 
							while working towards a high school diploma,” said Skip Hansen, Executive Vice President of Learn4Life. “We’ve found 
							that helping students develop real-world skills gives them a viable way to succeed after graduation; it also serves 
							as a big motivation to stay in school.”
							</p>
							<p>
							Empowering students through the practical application of subjects that might otherwise seem intimidating is a focus 
							of events like the SoCal Maker Convention. 
							</p>
							<p>
							“We want to inspire kids — and everyone else for that matter — and affirm their dreams,” said Aaron Berg, Public 
							Relations Director for J6 Events LLC, who organized the event. “There really is more to learning than being able to 
							solve equations. Learning begins with hands-on experiences.”
							</p>
							<p>
							The promotion of STEM disciplines by teaching practical skills is not new, but it is increasing in popularity due 
							to the widely publicized gap between the capabilities of the U.S. workforce and the needs of employers. According 
							to the National Center for Policy Analysis, by 2018 there could be 2.4 million STEM job vacancies. In response, 
							California State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Torlakson and California Assemblywoman Susan Bonilla 
							(14th District) formed a STEM Task Force comprised of 54 teachers, administrators, academics, business leaders 
							and legislators to develop a vision for California’s students. A report by the Task Force found that an 
							interdisciplinary approach, in which rigorous academic concepts are coupled with real-world lessons, could 
							improve the quality and level of STEM education in California.
