						“I wasn’t the type of girl to get into trouble,” Elizabeth explains. “I just never thought this 
						would happen to me.” When Elizabeth found out she was pregnant at age 14, her initial reaction 
						was shock. “I had no idea what I would do. It seemed like I wasn’t going to be able to do anything 
						in life. Like I’d have to drop out of school and get a part-time job at a fast food restaurant or 
						something.”
						</p>
						
						<p>
						With no access to childcare or a way to bring her baby to school, dropping out looked like the only 
						choice. Then a friend told her about Learn4Life. “I liked the idea that they offered a flexible schedule, 
						but still wasn’t sure who could take care of my daughter while I was in school. I called Learn4Life and 
						they said I could bring her with me.”

					<h4><B>A LITTLE INSPIRATION</B></h4>
					<div class="h-body">
						<p>
						Elizabeth’s supervising teacher worked with her to develop an academic plan to make up the missed credits, 
						to get back on track for graduation. Because of the time she had already missed, the schedule was ambitious, 
						but her teacher used a key insight to keep Elizabeth focused. “My teacher knew how important my daughter is 
						to me, and she talked to me about the type of life I want for her. It was then that I realized I have to 
						graduate on time and go to college — to teach my daughter that you can’t let anything in life hold you back.”
						</p>
						<p>
						With a lot of hard work, and a little inspiration, Elizabeth graduated on time and enrolled in her local 
						community college, where she is studying to become a nurse. Looking back on it all, Elizabeth explains that 
						she wouldn’t want it any other way. “I’ve gained maturity and a daughter who makes my life worth living. 
						Learn4Life helped me show her that anything is possible. They changed my story for the better.”
