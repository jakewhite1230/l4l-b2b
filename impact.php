						<p>
							Providing free educational assistance to more than 35,000 of California’s most at-risk students each year, 
							we’re creating tangible results that can be felt throughout the state. Every dropout we save contributes 
							to a decreased risk of poverty, joblessness, state-dependence and crime, and increases our state’s workforce, 
							taxable income, voting population and safety.
						</p>
						<p>
							The implications are staggering — for every 10-percentage-point increase in our state’s graduation rate, 
							California’s murder and assault rates will go down by about 20%, preventing 400 murders and more than 20,000 
							aggravated assaults each year¹.
						</p>
						<p>
							We envision a safer, more prosperous California, and our educational model is lighting the way to achieve it. 
							With an 86% graduation rate and the highest Academic Performance Index (API) scores and growth when compared to 
							alternative schools in the same areas, we’re transforming dropouts into educated, productive members of society.
						</p>
						<p>
							Before coming to Learn4Life, most of these students were on track to drop out of high school — now 40% of them 
							are going to college.

						<h4><B>COMMUNITY IMPACT</B></h4>
						Putting students back into schools means putting money back into the state. Instead of creating a 
						lifelong drain on public resources, the hundreds of thousands of dropouts we save go on to become 
						productive, contributing members of society. These graduates are on track to breaking the generational 
						chain of poverty, many as the first in their families to graduate with a high school diploma.
