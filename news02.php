							<b>Learn4Life Partners with United Way to End Veteran Homelessness</B>
							</p>
							<p>
							Ending homelessness is a team effort and one that is very much aligned with the Learn4Life mission of 
							improving lives and empowering communities. This year, the organization was proud to participate in The 
							United Way Home Walk, a 5K fundraiser to end veteran homelessness in Los Angeles.
							</p>
							<p>
							Three community teams of Learn4Life teachers, administrators and staff came together for a day of camaraderie 
							and charity joining nearly 12,000 participants in the walk which raised more than $1.1 million for the cause.
							</p>
							<p>
							Los Angeles County has long had the largest concentration of homeless veterans in the country — more than 6,000 
							according to the L.A. Times. This alarming statistic is the driving force behind Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti’s 
							vow to end veteran homelessness in the city. Garcetti’s promise was first announced during the Unite for Veterans 
							Summit, where mayors from 40 states, joined by First Lady Michelle Obama, committed to the Obama administration’s 
							challenge to end veteran homelessness.
							</p>
							<p>
							“The image of even one of these heroes sleeping out in the cold, huddled up next to an overpass – that should 
							horrify all of us,” said Mrs. Obama. “The truth is, we know that there are simple steps that we can take – whether 
							that’s in business or government or in our communities – to prevent and solve these kinds of problems.”
							</p>
							<p>
							Since its first walk eight years ago, 63,000 people have participated in The United Way Home Walk, raising more 
							than $5 million to move 15,900 Los Angeles veterans into housing. "Partnering with The United Way to end veteran 
							homelessness is another way we can create pathways out of poverty and improve the lives of citizens in neighborhoods 
							we serve,” said Skip Hansen, Executive Vice President of Learn4Life. “And that’s something we can all feel good about.”
