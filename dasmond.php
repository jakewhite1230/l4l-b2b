						“When I was in school, the teacher would be talking to the class, but I didn’t feel like she was talking 
						to me,” says Dasmond. “I had trouble with reading and that made it hard for me to understand the lessons. 
						I was afraid to ask for extra help, so I just fell behind.” As it grew more difficult to catch up, Dasmond 
						began to wonder if there was a better way to spend his time. “I started to think that school just wasn’t 
						for me.”
						</p>
						<p>
						When Dasmond dropped out, he was on the fast track to becoming a very real statistic; in fact, African-American 
						male dropouts are three times more likely to go to prison than their Caucasian counterparts.  “I was just hanging 
						out on the streets, up to no good. I was probably going to end up in jail.”

						After becoming a father, everything changed. “I knew I wanted to be a good father who could provide for 
						my daughter. And that meant going back to school and getting a career.” Dasmond’s girlfriend told him about 
						Learn4Life and Dasmond agreed to try it out. “I was really surprised that my teacher took the time to get 
						to know me personally. It felt like she really cared about me.”
						</p>
						<p>
						To address his reading challenge, Dasmond’s supervising teacher created a system where teachers and tutors 
						would read aloud with him during lessons. “I didn’t feel like I was doing it alone. They would read it with me. 
						And then before I knew it, I was reading entire novels by myself.” Dasmond graduated from Learn4Life last 
						spring and wrote a poem for his teacher to thank her. Now, he studies English at his local community college 
						and works part-time.
