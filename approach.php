					<h4><B>OUR APPROACH</B></h4>
					<div class="h-body">
						<p>
							Without the educational and emotional support they need, at-risk students find it impossible 
							to get back on track — and they will simply give up on learning. At Learn4Life, we’ve built 
							a model that interrupts the dropout cycle and gives these kids a path to succeed in high 
							school… and beyond.
						</p>
						<p>
							Based on the belief that every student is a potential graduate, we transform “at risk” to 
							“ready for success.” It starts with believing in our students, but it doesn’t end there. 
							Every student is assigned to a supervising teacher who identifies and addresses his or her 
							emotional, physical and psychological stumbling blocks to learning.
						</p>
						<p>
							An emphasis on goal setting helps students focus on graduation, while also preparing them 
							for life beyond. Programs such as Extracurricular Team-Building, Career Training Education, 
							Soft Skills Education and College Preparatory Tracks provide valuable real-world experience 
							and lead to greater confidence. Our vision of success is about more than a diploma — so we 
							hold students accountable to their highest levels of academic achievement.

					<h4><B>REMOVING EVERY OBSTACLE</B></h4>
					<p>
						We take the time to get to know each student, and then tailor his or her educational experience for 
						a high rate of success. Each step of the way, we work to remove all obstacles in the way of a student’s 
						high school diploma.

						we support a college- and career-centered focus on the future. As many as 40% of our students enroll in college 
						to continue their education, and many more go on to pursue technical careers using the skills they’ve gained 
						through our Career Technical Education programs.
