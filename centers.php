							When a student walks through the doors of a Learn4Life Resource Center, they are greeted by name 
							and welcomed into a large, open classroom with one-on-one teacher interactions, open computer stations, 
							quiet study desks and tutors waiting to help. It is a classroom unlike any other — and it comes with a 
							high rate of success. Because we offer students an individualized, flexible learning experience, we hold 
							them responsible for their education, and they live up to the challenge.

					<h4><B>TRANSFORMING CALIFORNIA’S AT-RISK STUDENTS</B></h4>
					<p>
						In 70+ Resource Centers throughout California, we’re helping tens of thousands of at-risk students 
						regain their sense of hope for the future. Every dropout saved represents hundreds of thousands of 
						dollars funneled back into our economy and a noticeable impact on our communities’ public safety¹.
					</p>
					<h4><B>A SCALABLE APPROACH WITH BOUNDLESS POTENTIAL</B></h4>
					<p>
						What began as one Resource Center with 30 students has quickly grown to more than 70, serving over 
						35,000 students each year. We’re honored to have helped hundreds of thousands of students change the 
						stories they thought were already written. Their hard work and success drives us to work toward ending 
						the dropout problem in California… and beyond.
					</p>
					<h4><B>CENTERS OF HOPE</B></h4>
					<p>
						More than half of the students we serve start out two or more years behind in their education, but 
						through our program of advanced academic support and tutoring, goal-setting and mentorship, we’re able 
						to boost our state’s lowest-performing students to an impressive 86% graduation rate. Many of our Resource 
						Centers are located in low-income communities, offering a safe, warm and quiet place to learn.

					<h4><B>BUILDING STRONGER COMMUNITIES</B></h4>

						We drive economic development by creating new resource centers in stagnant retail plazas — 
						they act as anchors that revive and attract other businesses. Partnering with local businesses 
						and community leaders, our job-training programs contribute to a more skilled and productive 
						workforce. The effect is a tangible difference that can be felt throughout the neighborhood.

				<div class="col-md-3 col-sm-6 highlight text-left location-name">
					<h4>RIVERSIDE</h4>
					<div class="h-body">
						<p>
							(RIVERSIDE COUNTY)<br>
							Riverside’s economy is significantly impacted by the manufacturing industry. Thanks to our 
							localized Career Technical Education (CTE) programs, students earn vocational certifications 
							alongside school credits, giving them one more reason to stay in school. In our first year in 
							Riverside, the entire county’s graduation rate rose by nearly one percentage point².

					<h4>LANCASTER</h4>
					<div class="h-body">
						<p>
							(LOS ANGELES COUNTY)<br>
							When we opened our first learning center in 2001, 16% of Lancaster’s population lived at or below 
							the poverty level³, and many Lancaster students were at risk of dropping out. What started as one 
							learning center with only 30 students has quickly grown to several, servicing more than 1,300 
							students per week. The good news: Lancaster’s young adult dropout population has fallen 
							from 35% to 19%.

					<h4>EL CAJON</h4>
					<div class="h-body">
						<p>
							(SAN DIEGO COUNTY)<br>
							Today, there are 50,000 Chaldeans living in San Diego County, many of whom are uneducated refugee 
							students who are too old to attend public schools⁶. To address the challenge, we hired Chaldean-speaking 
							teachers and tutors to help students acclimate to life in a new country, and complete their secondary 
							schooling. Today, we serve nearly 1,000 students in San Diego County.

					<h4>FRESNO</h4>
					<div class="h-body">
						<p>
							(FRESNO COUNTY)<br>
							Fresno, one of California’s fastest-growing counties⁷, has the highest poverty rate in the state and 
							the second highest in the nation⁸ ⁹. Working agricultural jobs⁹, residents tend to live in rural areas, 
							far from educational resources. Our Mobile Learning Center brings school to rural students, significantly 
							improving attendance and giving them a viable path towards graduation… and out of poverty.

					<h4><B>OUR PARTNERSHIPS</B></h4>
						<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 highlight">
							<div class="h-body ">
							<h4>EDUCATION</h4>
								<p>
									Through partnerships with local schools, parents, and teachers, at-risk students and dropouts 
									are referred to Learn4Life. In our fully accredited program, highly qualified, credentialed 
									teachers help get students back on track with CORE curriculum so they can recover credits and 
									return to graduate with their class. For students who have “aged out” of the public school system, 
									we offer a second chance to earn a real high school diploma — an opportunity that would otherwise 
									have been impossible. Sponsoring districts monitor our progress, facilitated by an independent 
									board that audits our program regularly. Our school board partners have been pleased with the 
									results — we consistently maintain the highest Academic Performance Index (API) scores and 
									growth when compared to other alternative schools in the same areas.
								</p>
							</div>
							<br>
							<div class="h-body ">
							<h4>CORPORATE</h4>
								<p>
									As a Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) partner, we work with local businesses and 
									national corporations to provide relevant job training to students in need. Boosting work readiness 
									skills not only improves our students’ chances for employability, it also strengthens our state’s 
									workforce and economy.
